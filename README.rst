        How to specify the target directory?
    
        1. By the default the audio files are moved or renamed to the parent
           working directory.
        2. Use the option ``-t <folder>`` or ``--target <folder>`` to specifiy
           a target directory.
        3. Use the option ``-a`` or ``--source-as-target`` to copy or rename
           your audio files within the source directory.

        $albumstatus:                The status describes how "official" a release
                                     is.

                                     Examples: ['Karajan, Mutter', 'Karajan, StaDre']

                                     Examples: ['I. Allegro', 'Akt III, Szene V. "Morgendlich leuchtend im rosigen Schein" (Walther, Volk, Meister, Sachs, Pogner, Eva)']

                                     leading zeros. If no Roman numbers could be
                                     found, then the field “ar_combined_disctrack”
                                     is used.

                                     “albumartist_sort” -> “artist_sort”. If no
                                     value could be determined, then “Unknown” is
                                     assigned. The second artist after “feat.”,
                                     “ft.” or “vs.” is removed.

                                     is assigned. The second artist after “feat.”,
                                     “ft.” or “vs.” is removed.

                                     spine or near the barcode. There may be more

      The following arguments are intended to select the audio files.
    
      source                A folder containing audio files or a single audio
                            file. If you specify a folder, the program will search
                            for audio files in all subfolders. If you want to
                            rename the audio files in the current working
                            directory, then specify a dot (“.”).
      -t TARGET, --target TARGET
                            Target directory
      -a, --source-as-target
                            Use specified source folder as target directory
    
    [rename]:
      These options configure the actual renaming process.
    
      -p BACKUP_FOLDER, --backup-folder BACKUP_FOLDER
                            Folder to store the backup files in.
      -B, --best-format     Use the best format. This option only takes effect if
                            the target file already exists. `audiorename` now
                            checks the qualtity of the two audio files (source and
                            target). The tool first examines the format. For
                            example a FLAC file wins over a MP3 file. Then
                            `audiorename` checks the bitrate.
      -d, --dry-run         Don’t rename or copy the audio files.
    
    move action:
      -C, --copy            Copy files instead of rename / move.
      -M, --move            Move / rename a file. This is the default action. The
                            option can be omitted.
      -n, --no-rename       Don’t rename, move, copy or perform a dry run. Do
                            nothing.
    
    cleaning action:
      The cleaning actions are only executed if the target file already exists.
    
      -A, --backup          Backup the audio files instead of deleting them. The
                            backup directory can be specified with the --backup-
                            folder option.
      -D, --delete          Delete the audio files instead of creating a backup.
    
    [filters]:
      The following options filter the music files that are renamed according to certain rules.
    
      -F, --album-complete  Rename only complete albums.

    [template_settings]:
      -k, --classical       Use the default format for classical music. If you use
                            this option, both parameters (--default and
                            --compilation) have no effect. Classical music is
                            sorted by the lastname of the composer.
      -S, --shell-friendly  Rename audio files “shell friendly”, this means
                            without whitespaces, parentheses etc.
      --no-soundtrack       Do not use the path template for soundtracks. Use
                            instead the default path template.

      -c PATH_TEMPLATE, --compilation PATH_TEMPLATE
                            Path template for compilations. Use metadata fields
                            and functions to build the path template.
      --soundtrack PATH_TEMPLATE
                            Path template for a soundtrack audio file. Use
                            metadata fields and functions to build the path
                            template.
      --format-classical PATH_TEMPLATE
                            Path template for classical audio file. Use metadata

                            fields.
      -j, --job-info        Display informations about the current job. This
                            informations are printted out before any actions on
                            the audio files are executed.
      -l, --mb-track-listing
                            Print track listing for Musicbrainz website: Format:
                            track. title (duration), e. g.: 1. He, Zigeuner (1:31)

                            The audio file must have the tag field “mb_trackid”.
                            The give audio file is not renamed.
      -r, --remap-classical
                            Remap some fields to fit better for classical music:
                            “composer” becomes “artist”, “work” becomes “album”,
                            from the “title” the work prefix is removed
                            (“Symphonie No. 9: I. Allegro” -> “I. Allegro”) and
                            “track” becomes the movement number. All overwritten
                            fields are safed in the “comments” field.
    

Configuration files
===================

Use the ``--config`` option to load a configuration file. The command
line arguments overwrite the corresponding options of the configuration
file.

.. code-block:: Shell

    audiorenamer --config /home/user/my-config.ini

It is also possible to load several configuration files. Values of the
latter file overwrite the values of the first files.

.. code-block:: Shell

    audiorenamer --config base.ini --config overload.ini

Almost all command line arguments have a corresponding option in the
configuration file. ``audiorename`` implements a basic configuration
language which provides a structure similar to what’s found in Microsoft
Windows `INI
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html#supported-ini-file-structure>`_
