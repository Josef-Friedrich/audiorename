        Rename audio files from metadata tags.
    
        How to specify the target directory?
    
        1. By the default the audio files are moved or renamed to the parent
           working directory.
        2. Use the option ``-t <folder>`` or ``--target <folder>`` to specifiy
           a target directory.
        3. Use the option ``-a`` or ``--source-as-target`` to copy or rename
           your audio files within the source directory.

                                     The album “Weezer” for example has the
                                     disambiguation comments “Red Album” and
                                     “Green Album”.
    
        $albumstatus:                The status describes how "official" a release
                                     is.
                                     Examples: ['official', 'promotional', 'bootleg', 'pseudo-release']
    
        $albumtype:                  The MusicBrainz album type; the MusicBrainz
                                     wiki has a list of type names

        $ar_classical_album:         The field “work” without the movement suffix.

                                     “Horn Concerto”
    
        $ar_classical_performer:     “ar_performer_short” or “albumartist” without
                                     the composer prefix: “Beethoven; Karajan,
                                     Mutter” -> “Karajan, Mutter”
    
        $ar_classical_title:         The movement title without the parent work
                                     prefix. For example “Horn Concerto: I.
                                     Allegro” -> “I. Allegro”
    
        $ar_classical_track:         If the title contains Roman numbers, then
                                     these are converted to arabic numbers with
                                     leading zeros. If no Roman numbers could be
                                     found, then the field “ar_combined_disctrack”
                                     is used.
    
        $ar_combined_album:          “album” without ” (Disc X)”.

                                     “ar_combined_artist”
    
        $ar_combined_composer:       The first not empty field of this field list:
                                     “composer_sort”, “composer”,
                                     “ar_combined_artist”
    
        $ar_combined_disctrack:      Combination of disc and track in the format:
                                     disk-track, e.g. 1-01, 3-099
    
        $ar_combined_soundtrack:     Boolean flag which indicates if the audio

                                     “ar_combined_album”.
    
        $ar_initial_artist:          First character in lowercase of

        $ar_initial_composer:        First character in lowercase of
                                     “ar_combined_composer”. For example “Ludwig
                                     van Beethoven” -> “l”

        $artist_credit:              The track-specific artist credit name, which
                                     may be a variation of the artist’s
                                     “canonical” name
    
        $artist_sort:                The “sort name” of the track artist.

        $barcode:                    There are many different types of barcode,
                                     but the ones usually found on music releases
                                     are two: 1. Universal Product Code (UPC),
                                     which is the original barcode used in North
                                     America. 2. European Article Number (EAN)
                                     Examples: ['5028421931838', '036000291452']

                                     the label which can often be found on the
                                     spine or near the barcode. There may be more
                                     than one, especially when multiple labels are
                                     involved. This is not the ASIN — there is a
                                     relationship for that — nor the label code.

                            Musicbrainz and save this fields into the audio file.
                            The audio file must have the tag field “mb_trackid”.
                            The give audio file is not renamed.
      -r, --remap-classical
    
    rename:

                            example a FLAC file wins over a MP3 file. Then
                            `audiorename` checks the bitrate.

                            nothing.
    
    rename cleaning actions:
      The cleaning actions are only executed if the target file already exists.
    
      -A, --backup          Backup the audio files instead of deleting them. The
                            backup directory can be specified with the --backup-
